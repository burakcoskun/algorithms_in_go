# algorithms_in_go

I will implement many algorithms and data structures in this repo, I will be using golang for this which I am not currently familiar with.

This repo is a way for me to remember algorithms, learn new ones and while doing this also learn Go language.

I will try to add fair amount of tests to the algorithms I will implement, but the purpose is not to make this a library for production use.
